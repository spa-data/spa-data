The following files are in __CSV__ format and have been extracted from the __[SPA Correspondence Sites](http://arcg.is/vOTC8)__ project.

Each file is a data transfer from one of the four map layers and contains the latitude and longitude for the plotted locations. (NB: Latitude and longitude are given as XY coordinates, so the 'x' column contains _longitude_ and the 'y' column contains _latitude_.)

## Prokofiev's Sketchbooks

These files contain machine-readable transcriptions of musical fragments from Prokofiev's sketchbooks. Samples from each notebooks have been made __[available here](../sketches)__. Files were encoded using Sibelius and Musescore, then exported in MusicXML format, then converted to MEI files. The encoded files were also exported to SVG files for display.
The __[Sketches](../sketches)__ page displays the MEI using Verovio, which also converts the MEI to a MIDI stream playable in the web browser.
